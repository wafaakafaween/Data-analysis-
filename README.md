**WELCOME! to my Earthdata analysis project🌍**

>Earthdata is a part of the Earth Science Data Systems Program created by NASA that provides data sets based on the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, solar flares, cryosphere, geomagnetism, tectonics, etc.

In my project, I collected data about objects that are in the rotating axis of the Earth, and I tried to analyze this data to study its ability to form danger on Earth!
